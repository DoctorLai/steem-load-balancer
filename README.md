# Steem Load Balancer
[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/DoctorLai/steem-load-balancer/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/DoctorLai/steem-load-balancer/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

## Overview
The Steem Load Balancer is a Node.js-based application designed to distribute API requests across a list of predefined Steem Blockchain RPC Nodes. It enhances application availability and reliability by routing requests to the most responsive node. 

This project was developed by STEEM's Top Witness, [@justyy](https://steemyy.com), who also established Two STEEM Load Balancer RPC Nodes, [steem.justyy.com](https://steem.justyy.com) (New York) and [api.steemyy.com](https://api.steemyy.com) (London), using this project as its foundation.

A similar service, [https://steem.senior.workers.dev/](https://steem.senior.workers.dev/), is based on CloudFlare Worker which runs at the CloudFlare Edge Network but comes with a daily quota of 100,000 requests.

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to provide a scalable and reliable Load Balancer Node that can be integrated into applications to improve their availability and performance. Unlike CloudFlare-based solutions, this setup does not have a daily request quota, making it suitable for high-demand applications.

Please note that this can be easily configured to work with other Blockchains such as Hive and Blurt.

## Features
- Load Balancing: Distributes requests across multiple Steem API servers. The `jussi_num` and `status` are checked before a node is chosen (See below).
- Rate Limiting: Protects against abuse by limiting the number of requests. For example, maximum 300 requests per 60 second window. This can be set in the [config.yaml](./config.yaml).
- Logging: Provides detailed logs for debugging and monitoring.
- SSL Support: Configurable SSL certificates for secure HTTPS communication. Reject or Ignore the SSL certificates when forwarding the requests via the field `rejectUnauthorized` in [config.yaml](./config.yaml)

### A Healthy Node
A Steem RPC node should return the following to indicate the healthy state. The `jussi_num` needs to catch up with the latest block height. If the `jussi_num` is far behind, e.g. the `max_jussi_number_diff` in [config.yaml](./config.yaml), then the node will not be considered. Currently, it is set to 100.

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "datetime": "2025-02-01T11:06:30.781448",
  "source_commit": "ae6c6c77601436e496a8816ece2cbc6e26fbe3c2",
  "docker_tag": "latest",
  "jussi_num": 92629431
}
```

## Configuration

```

### Configuration Options
- nodes: An array of API server URLs to which requests will be distributed. You can add or remove nodes as needed.
- rateLimit: Configuration for rate limiting.
- windowMs: Time window in milliseconds for the rate limit (e.g., 60000 ms = 1 minute).
- maxRequests: Maximum number of requests allowed in the time window.
- version: The version of the Steem Load Balancer.
- max_age: Cache duration for responses in seconds (GET).
- logging: Boolean value to enable or disable logging.
- sslCertPath: Path to the SSL certificate file for HTTPS communication.
- sslKeyPath: Path to the SSL key file for HTTPS communication.
- user_agent: User Agent String in the Header to forward.
- min_blockchain_version: Min blockchain version number e.g. 0.23.0 to decide the validity of a node.
- max_payload_size: Max payload size.
- max_jussi_number_diff: The maximum difference of block difference is allowed.
- logging_max_body_len: truncate the request.body in log.
- retry_count: Retry count for GET and POST forward requests. There is a 100ms between retries.
- rejectUnauthorized: Should we ignore SSL errors? Default false
- timeout: Max timeout (milliseconds) for fetch to time out.
- plimit: Max concurrent requests to poke the servers. Reduce this if the server is laggy.

## Installation
Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/doctorlai/steem-load-balancer.git
cd steem-load-balancer
```

## Configure
Update the [config.yaml](./config.yaml) file with your desired nodes, rate limits, and SSL paths.

## Build the Docker Image
```bash
DOCKER_IMAGE=steem-load-balancer
HOST_PORT=8080

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t $DOCKER_IMAGE .
```

## Run the Server
```bash
docker run --name $DOCKER_IMAGE -p $HOST_PORT:8080 -v /root/.acme.sh/:/root/.acme.sh/ $DOCKER_IMAGE
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff6da76b-4506-4452-b742-04eeff7596b5)

## Build and Run
Use the following utility to build the docker and then start the server.

```bash
source ./setup-env.sh
./build.sh
./run.sh
```

## Test
Use the following script to perform a basic integration test â€” it builds the Docker image, starts the server locally, sends a request, and verifies that the response has a 'status' of 'OK' with a status code of 200.

```bash
source ./setup-env.sh
## on success, exit code is 0.
## on failure, exit code is 1.
./tests/integration-tests.sh
```

## Tools
Tools are placed at [./tools](./tools/) directory.

## View the Logs
```bash
docker logs -f steem-load-balancer
```

## SSL Configuration
If you have SSL certificates, provide the paths in the [config.yaml](./config.yaml) file. If SSL is not configured or the certificate files are missing, the server will default to HTTP.

## Rate Limiting
The rate limiting configuration prevents abuse by restricting the number of requests a user can make within a given time window. Adjust the rateLimit settings in [config.yaml](./config.yaml) as needed.

## Logging
Enable logging by setting "logging": true in [config.yaml](./config.yaml). Logs will be printed to the console and can help with debugging and monitoring.

## Statistics
On the GET requests, the response JSON will show some additional data including statistics (including Uptime, Access Counters, Error Counters, Not Chosen Counters and Jussi Behind Counters):

See the sample JSON response for sending a GET:

  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting
Port 443 is already taken: Ensure no other process is using port 443. Use sudo lsof -i :443 to check. Change the port in the configuration if needed.

SSL Certificate Issues: Ensure the SSL certificate and key files are in the correct format and paths are correctly specified.

## NODE_ENV
Setting NODE_ENV to "production" (by default) or "development".
